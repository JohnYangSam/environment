" In VIM, create or open an HTML file (or set the filetype to html), type in
" something (e.g. #header > h1), then press <C-E> whilst in insert mode to
" expand to HTML. Pressing <C-n> will cycle through empty elements. Variables
" specified in vim/README.txt can be used to customise key mappings, and to add
" normal mode mappings as well.
